# Voice controlled ARDB
*A small proof-of-concept of voice controlled [ARDB](https://github.com/ErikGartner/ardb) inventory manager for the ccg [VtES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire:_The_Eternal_Struggle)*

I wrote the small **proof-of-concept** many years ago. It's **not** under development anymore.

The accuracy using the Windows speech api was really good making the indexing of cards much faster.
